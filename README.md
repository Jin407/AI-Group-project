# AI-Group-project
This repository is for the group project we did in CSCI 323. In this project, by referring to several guides, we implemented 3 reinforcement learning algorithm Q-learning, SARSA and DQN to attempt to train an agent to navigate OpenAI's Taxi-V3 environment. There are four files which includes a jupyther notebook for our code execution and 3 python programme which is the GUI to play with the 3 reinforcement learning algorithm we implemented.

In the Jupyther notebook, you will find the training rate and performance of all 3 different reinforcement learning algorithm.

Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3
Git

To clone the repository, open terminal or cmd and run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Jin407/AI-Group-project

Alternatively, you can download the files directly from GitHub.

To run the programme:
